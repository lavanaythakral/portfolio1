Fantastic, thank you for showing further interest in the things I do!
I am Lavanay Thakral, and I am almost finishing up my dual degree in Physics and Computer Science from [BITS Pilani, Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa). 

I finished my undergraduate thesis at [Fluid Interfaces, MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/fluid-interfaces/overview/), working with [Pat Pataranutaporn](pat.design). We worked on building and deploying a pipeline as a text-based approach to what we term "Living Memory", an AI system resembling a real being. The core pipeline involved working with transformer-based models like GPT2 and BERT. I also built a small application demo using Flask(Python). A Colab notebook for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/lavanaythakral/IAI-Pipeline-demo/blob/main/KalamAI_T1.ipynb)

I spent Summer 2020 at Mathworks, working on building components docked on the canvas to effectively display the most important Sldv data. 

I have spent considerable time playing guitar at the Music Society at my university. My tastes have changed over time and I find myself listening to most genres, but I can never get enough of bands like [Lamb of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_of_God_(band)), [Megadeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megadeth), [Guns N' Roses](https://www.gunsnroses.com/), etc. 

Here's a really cool picture from the BITS Goa Auditorium. We played a metal version of Humble-Kendrick Lamar

I am interested in public policy and politics. Without a formal background in these, most of my knowledge comes from newspapers and articles. I have often found myself confused about the different driven narratives that surround a new policy. 

Here are my two cents: 
* Media pushes opinions instead of facts
* Facts are available through official sources, but it is exceedingly difficult to navigate through these documents. 
* Even with the facts laid down, lack of prior knowledge in ordinary citizens leads to inaccurate understanding of the policy and its effects. 

It would be useful to build AI systems to extract, simplify, and present accurate data and related prior work to users and help them make informed decisions. Please do reach me if you have any thoughts on this!
