Hi, I am Lavanay, and I am in my final semester at [BITS Pilani, Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa). I have been pursuing a dual major in Physics and Computer Science here.

The year 2020 has been significant in building myself as a software developer and exploring different interests. Over the last semester, I had been working at [Fluid Interfaces, MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/fluid-interfaces/overview/). You can check out more about this work in a blog soon! 
Before that, I interned at [Mathworks Bangalore](https://in.mathworks.com/?s_tid=gn_logo) and worked with the Simulink design verifier team. 	
In a month, I will be joining [Blue Jeans by Verizon](https://www.bluejeans.com/). I am excited about the projects I'll be working on there.

By the time I graduate in July, I will have ~ 1.2 years of software development experience. Recruiters are welcome to get in touch. 

This website is my pet project, and I aim to build this slowly and carefully with things that I find interesting and worth sharing.

Thank you for visiting my page!

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)
